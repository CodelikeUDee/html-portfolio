<h1>THE BEST ANIME EVER BY UDee</h1>
 <h2>My Top Three best anime</h2>

<hr/>

   <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
     <P>Hands down the best anime storyline i have ever seen. There are no boring episodes</P>
   <h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
     <p>Simply because if everyone were as compassionate as tanjiro, they'd be lesser evil.<br/>
     Simply put, a peak ANIME!</p>
   <h3>Doctor Stone</h3>
     <p>This makes science so fun, interesting and "exhilarating" like senku would say.</p>
